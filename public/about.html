    <div>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          At my Geomagnetic Research Station, I am testing a low-cost approach to geomagnetic data logging. The aim is to record and monitor changes in the magnetosphere using budget-friendly technology. This project seeks to provide useful insights into geomagnetic activities at a significantly lower cost than traditional methods.

        <h3>Data Logging System</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional geomagnetic research stations that utilize expensive fluxgate magnetometers, such as those used by AuroraWatch at Lancaster University, my station employs a more affordable solution. AuroraWatch monitors geomagnetic activity to provide alerts for auroras visible from the UK. They use high-precision fluxgate magnetometers to detect minute changes in the Earth's magnetic field, which are often associated with solar activity and auroras.

        <p>
          In contrast, I have opted for the Bosch BMM150 3-axis magnetometer, an economical alternative that still offers significant capabilities. The BMM150 is a small, low-power, triaxial magnetic field sensor. It is designed for consumer electronics but has potential for scientific research due to its compact size, low cost, and reasonable accuracy.

        <h3>Bosch BMM150 Magnetometer</h3>
        <p>
          The Bosch BMM150 is a versatile sensor used in various applications, including smartphones and wearable devices, for detecting the orientation and motion of the device. Key features of the BMM150 include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3-Axis Measurement:</strong> It measures the magnetic field in three perpendicular axes (X, Y, and Z), providing a comprehensive understanding of the geomagnetic environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Power Consumption:</strong> Designed to operate efficiently with minimal power, making it suitable for continuous monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Compact Size:</strong> Its small form factor allows for easy integration into various setups without requiring significant space.</li>
          <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> As a consumer-grade sensor, it is significantly cheaper than scientific-grade fluxgate magnetometers, making it an ideal choice for budget-conscious research projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Denoising and Data Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          To enhance the accuracy of the readings from the BMM150, I employ software algorithms to denoise the data. This process involves filtering out the background noise and other interferences that could affect the magnetometer's readings. By refining the data, I aim to discern meaningful changes in the magnetosphere, similar to the capabilities of more expensive research stations.

        <h3>Objectives and Applications</h3>
        <p>
          My primary objective is to determine if the BMM150 can reliably detect changes in the magnetosphere that correlate with geomagnetic phenomena such as auroras. While I acknowledge that this system may not measure the exact magnitude of these changes with high precision, the goal is to identify discernible patterns that could aid in forecasting aurora borealis visibility. This effort is particularly relevant when combined with data from NASA's Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) reports, which provide critical information on solar activities influencing geomagnetic conditions.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          My Geomagnetic Research Station is testing a low-cost approach to geomagnetic monitoring using the Bosch BMM150 magnetometer and data processing techniques. By exploring the potential of this affordable technology, I aim to contribute valuable data to the scientific community and enhance aurora forecasting capabilities. I invite you to explore my research and data, and join me in making geomagnetic monitoring more accessible.
